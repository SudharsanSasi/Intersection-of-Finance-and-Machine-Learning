1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Acquisition: I fetched Infosys' stock data for 40 days (start='2023-09-01', end='2023-10-01') using the incredible yfinance library.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Volatility Smoothing: To address inherent stock price volatility, I applied the savgol_filter to smoothen the curve, providing a clearer view of underlying trends.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Key Points: Using a custom function (min_max_points), I pinpointed local minimum and maximum points in the smoothed line, crucial for determining support and resistance levels.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Regression Magic: Leveraging fundamental Linear Regression principles in supervised learning, I drew two pivotal lines. The Support Line connects all low points, while the Resistance Line links all high points.

üìä Outcome: The result? A predictive model showcasing Infosys' support and resistance levels, offering valuable insights for traders navigating the market.
